Project Justification – “PragStyle” Commercial Website

This project is a commercial website for a fictional brand “PragStyle”, selling premium shoes and goggles. I built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following modern web design practices like responsive layout, product cards, categories, testimonials, and newsletter subscription.

	•	HTML structures the content into clear sections like header, hero, products, and footer.
	•	CSS handles styling using variables and responsive design with Flexbox/Grid.
	•	JavaScript adds interactivity like generating products and updating cart count.


Learning Sources and Resources Used

To build this project, I learned key concepts from two main online resources:
	1.	Apna College’s JavaScript Tutorial on YouTube
      I followed Apna College’s JavaScript playlist to understand the basics of JavaScript, including:
	        •	How to use variables, functions, and arrays
      	  •	How to work with the DOM (Document Object Model)
      	  •	Adding interactivity using event listeners
      	  •	Making a dynamic product list using JavaScript logic
      This helped me create features like dynamic product cards and a live cart count.

	2.	YouTube Tutorial – “Build a Full Modern Website”
      Link to the video : https://youtu.be/bYvgvYWqMn0?si=sWCRP_2_nzaiJp7B
      This video taught me how to design a commercial website layout from scratch. I learned:
	        •	How to structure different website sections (hero, featured products, testimonials,                    etc.)
	        •	Styling techniques using CSS Flexbox and Grid
        	•	Creating a responsive layout that works on all devices
        	•	Integrating Google Fonts and Bootstrap Icons to enhance the UI


Image Sources :
	•	Some images used in this project were AI-generated by ChatGPT based on my prompts to match           the product themes (e.g., realistic shoes and goggles).
	•	Other images were carefully selected from Google, ensuring they matched the brand’s look and         feel.
